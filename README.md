# 🎛️ MainBoard

**MainBoard** is a custom-designed PCB that integrates:
- a **microcontroller** for digital control,
- a **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)** for precise audio signal generation, and
- an **LM386 preamplifier** for driving small speakers or line-level outputs.

It’s designed as a compact platform for audio signal generation and amplification projects — ideal for synth enthusiasts, hobbyists, and embedded developers.
